# For Delaney:
1. For Monday: 
    - Basic diffusivity, velocity, and forcing maps
2. For Wednesday:
    - Expand paper:
        - Inverse PINN conditioned on input maps

# Generally:
## Implementation
- Implement locally fully-connected convolution
- Implement Xavier initialization
- Profile network and try to speed up
- Batch processing

## Writing
- Remake figures in README.md and for Delaney's paper
- Rewrite in README how module works
    - "PINN for inverse vector-field parameterized PDE conditioned on solution"
